# android-force-immersive-mode
Force immersive mode on any apps for android devices with UI system buttons
  
## How it works
This script allows you to force any Android application to enter "Immersive Mode".
Immersive mode hides the Status Bar and Navigation Bar and will show them when swiping from the side of your screen.
For this script to work, Developer options and USB Debugging must be enabled on your device.
  
## Enabling Developer Options and USB Debugging on an Android Device
* To enable Developer Options, open the Settings screen, scroll down to the bottom, and tap About phone or About tablet.  
* Scroll down to the bottom of the About screen and find the Build number.  
* Tap the Build number field seven times to enable Developer Options. Tap a few times and you’ll see a toast notification with a countdown that reads “You are now X steps way from being a developer.”  
* When you’re done, you’ll see the message “You are now a developer!”.   
* Tap the Back button and you’ll see the Developer options menu just above the “About Phone” section in Settings. 
* This menu is now enabled on your device—you won’t have to repeat this process again unless you perform a factory *reset.  
* To enable USB Debugging, you’ll need to jump into the Developer options menu, scroll down to the Debugging section, and toggle the “USB Debugging” slider. (USB Debugging should be toggled back off when you are finished with the script)
